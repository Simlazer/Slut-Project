<p class="right_text" id="colorChange1"> In the picture to the right we have a graphicscard made by NVIDIA called RTX 3090. The GeForce 30 series is a family of graphics processing units developed by Nvidia, succeeding the GeForce 20 series. The series was announced on September 1, 2020. and started shipping on September 17, 2020. The cards are based on the Ampere architecture and feature hardware-accelerated raytracing (RTX) with Nvidia's second-generation RT cores and third generation Tensor Cores.

    The lineup, which is designed to compete with AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series and Intel's Arc Alchemist series of cards, consist of the entry-level and previously laptop-exclusive RTX 3050 and laptop-exclusive RTX 3050 Ti, mid-range RTX 3060, RTX 3060 Ti, high-end RTX 3070, RTX 3070 Ti, RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 12GB, and the enthusiast RTX 3080 Ti, and RTX 3090. This is the last generation from NVIDIA to have official support for Windows 7 and 8.x as the latest drivers available for this generation require Windows 10.

The GeForce 20 series is a family of graphics processing units developed by Nvidia. Serving as the successor to the GeForce 10 series, the line started shipping on September 20, 2018, and after several editions, on July 2, 2019, the GeForce RTX Super line of cards was announced.

    The 20 series marked the introduction of Nvidia's Turing microarchitecture, and the first generation of RTX cards. the first in the industry to implement realtime hardware ray tracing in a consumer product. In a departure from Nvidia's usual strategy, the 20 series has no entry level range, leaving it to the 16 series to cover this segment of the market.
    
    These cards are succeeded by the GeForce 30 series, powered by the Ampere microarchitecture. (Wikipedia 2022)</p> <br><br><br>
